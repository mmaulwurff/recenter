# Recenter

Recenter is an add-on for GZDoom that recenters the screen. Like `centerview`
CCMD, but gradual and automatic.

## How to use

Recenter is controlled by two cvars:
- `rc_enable` - controls if the mod is enabled (default: true);
- `rc_step` - controls the speed of recentering (default: 1.0). Greater values
  mean faster recentering.

## Known issues

- Recenter desyncs multiplayer. Maybe will be fixed later if there is any
  demand.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to lucker42 for the idea.
